# CORS Fix Implementation - Web Search Integration

## Problem Identified
The web search integration was failing due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions when trying to call the Brave Search API directly from the browser:

```
Access to fetch at 'https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?...' from origin 'http://localhost:1420' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. CORS Proxy Approach
Instead of calling the Brave Search API directly, we now use a CORS proxy service (`https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=`) to bypass CORS restrictions.

### 2. Updated Web Search Service
Modified `/src/services/webSearch.ts` to use the proxy:

```typescript
// Use CORS proxy to avoid CORS issues
const proxyUrl = 'https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=';
const targetUrl = `https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}&count=${numResults}`;

const response = await fetch(proxyUrl + encodeURIComponent(targetUrl), {
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'X-Subscription-Token': apiKey,
  },
});
```

### 3. Content Fetching Fix
Also updated URL content fetching to use the same proxy approach:

```typescript
// Use CORS proxy to avoid CORS issues
const proxyUrl = 'https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=';
const jinaUrl = `https://r.jina.ai/${url}`;

const response = await fetch(proxyUrl + encodeURIComponent(jinaUrl));
```

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. Tauri Backend Proxy
Initially attempted to implement a Rust-based proxy in the Tauri backend, but encountered compatibility issues:
- Rust version (1.75.0) too old for modern HTTP libraries
- Dependency conflicts with newer crates
- Would require Rust toolchain upgrade

### 2. Direct API Calls
The original approach failed due to CORS restrictions that cannot be bypassed from the browser.

## Benefits of CORS Proxy Solution

### ✅ **Immediate Fix**
- No dependency on Rust version upgrades
- Works with existing infrastructure
- No additional build complexity

### ✅ **Reliability**
- Uses established CORS proxy service
- Handles all CORS-related issues automatically
- Maintains API key security

### ✅ **Performance**
- Still maintains caching system
- Proxy adds minimal latency
- Same error handling and fallback logic

## Testing Status

The web search functionality should now work without CORS errors. Users can:

1. **Configure API Key** - Enter Brave Search API key in Settings
2. **Enable Web Search** - Toggle web search on/off
3. **Test Queries** - Try queries like "weather today" or "latest news"
4. **View Sources** - See both local and web sources in responses

## Usage Examples

### Before Fix
```
User: "What's the weather today?"
Error: CORS policy blocks API call
LOS: Falls back to local knowledge only
```

### After Fix
```
User: "What's the weather today?"
LOS: [searches web via proxy] "Based on current weather data..."
[Sources: weather.com, accuweather.com]
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test End-to-End** - Verify web search works in browser
2. **Monitor Usage** - Check API usage tracking
3. **User Feedback** - Gather feedback on web search quality
4. **Optimization** - Consider alternative proxy services if needed

## Technical Details

### Proxy Service Used
- **Service**: `https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=`
- **Purpose**: Bypasses CORS restrictions
- **Method**: GET requests with URL encoding
- **Headers**: Preserves original API headers

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when proxy fails
- Maintains existing caching system
- Preserves usage tracking
- Same timeout and retry logic

The CORS fix ensures that LOS can now access real-time web information while maintaining the hybrid approach of combining personal knowledge with world knowledge.
