Born George Allen Aarons on October 29, 1916 in New York, NY, he served as a military photographer before turning to print journalism after the war. He chronicled the leisure pursuits of the rich and famous in stunning environments, letting the natural beauty of his subjects become his focal point. Aarons won the trust of those he photographed, and in turn, was allowed to shoot some of the most intimate and candid portraiture of the 20th century. He died May 29, 2006 in Montrose, NY at the age of 89. In 2007, Getty Images released a book of the artist’s work Poolside With Slim Aarons, putting a capstone on his legacy.\nRelated Categories\n\nContemporary Art, Fashion Photography, Photography\n\nRelated Artists\n\nDavid Bailey, Helmut Newton, Martin Schoeller\n\nSlim Aarons Artworks\nArtworks for Sale &\nAuction Results\nAvailability\nFor Sale (58)\nartnet Auctions (0)\nGalleries (58)\nAuction Houses (0)\nAuction Results (252)\nObject Type\nPhotographs (290)\nPrints and multiples (57)\nSculpture (1)\nPeriod\nSlim Aarons (310 results)\nRECENTLY ADDED\n \nBACK TO TOP\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nPoolside Gossip, 1970\n\nFahey/Klein Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nDaniel Gainey (3/150), 1970\n\nWest Chelsea Contemporary\n\nSold\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nPark Avenue Party: Slim Hawks, Diana..., 1952\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nCharles (Lucky) Luciano, Sicily, Italy, 1949\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nPoolside Pairs: Lita Baron, Nelda Linsk, and , 1970\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nKeep your Cool: Carmen Alvarez enjoying a..., 1978\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nPoolside Pairs: Lita Baron, Nelda Linsk, and , 1970\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nPoolside Pairs: Lita Baron, Nelda Linsk,..., 1970\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nExcelsior Hotel Gala, Venice , 1957\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nKings of Hollywood: Clark Gable, Van Heflin, , 1957\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nBelfast, Ireland, 1962\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nSS Queen of Bermuda in Hamilton Harbor, 1957\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nChristmas Swim: Rita Aarons in Hollywood,..., 1958\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nChristmas Swim: Rita Aarons in Hollywood,..., 1954\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nSea Drive: Film producer Kevin McClory takes , 1967\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nPool on Amalfi Coast: Hotel St. Caterina,..., 1984\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nLido Life, Venice, 1957\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nLake Tahoe Trip: Nevada, 1959\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nLa Jolla Beach Club, 1955\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nHotel du Cap Eden-Roc: Guests by the pool at , 1972\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nCatherine Wilke, Capri, 1980\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nIl Canile (Villa owned by Umberto Tirelli..., 1980\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nSkating at the Palace Hotel, 1989\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nSlim Aarons\n\nSkiing Waiters, Stowe, Vermont, 1962\n\nStaley-Wise Gallery\n\nPrice on Request\n\nLOAD MORE\n\n\nPrice Database Market Alerts Analytics Reports Gallery Network Auction House Partnerships\nAbout Contact Investor Relations Jobs FAQSite Map Advertise Terms Privacy Cookies\nfacebook twitter pinterest> instagram\"> weibo\">\nEnglish (US)\n\n©2024 Artnet Worldwide Corporation.
