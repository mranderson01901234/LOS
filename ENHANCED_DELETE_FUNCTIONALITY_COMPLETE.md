### 3. **Enhanced System Prompt**

## üîÑ How the Enhanced Delete Flow Works

### **Step 1: User Request**
```
User: "Delete all my old photography documents"
```

### **Step 2: Agent Finds Documents**
```typescript
// Agent uses find_documents_to_delete tool
{
  search_query: "photography",
  filter_type: "all",
  limit: 10
}
```

### **Step 3: Agent Shows Preview**
```
Agent: "I found 5 documents related to photography:

1. "Camera Settings Guide" (note, added 2024-01-15)
   Tags: [photography, camera, settings]
   Preview: "Understanding aperture, shutter speed, and ISO..."

2. "Portrait Lighting Tips" (url, added 2024-01-20)
   Tags: [photography, lighting, portraits]
   Preview: "Natural lighting techniques for portrait photography..."

Would you like me to delete these 5 documents? Please confirm by saying 'yes' or 'confirm'."
```

### **Step 4: User Confirmation**
```
User: "Yes, delete them"
```

### **Step 5: Agent Executes Deletion**
```typescript
// Agent uses delete_documents tool with confirm: true
{
  document_ids: ["doc1", "doc2", "doc3", "doc4", "doc5"],
  confirm: true,
  reason: "user requested deletion of photography documents"
}
```

### **Step 6: Confirmation of Deletion**
```
Agent: "Successfully deleted 5 document(s): Camera Settings Guide, Portrait Lighting Tips, ..."
```
