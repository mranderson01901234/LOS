# 🔧 LOS Sidebar & New Chat Fixes

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. **Sidebar Layout Issue** - FIXED
**Problem:** The conversation section was causing the sidebar to break out of single-pane view and take up too much space.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Made conversation section more compact with smaller padding
- ✅ Added proper flex layout with `flex-1 overflow-hidden flex flex-col`
- ✅ Made conversation list scrollable with `overflow-y-auto`
- ✅ Reduced button and text sizes for better space usage
- ✅ Made navigation section `flex-shrink-0` to prevent compression
- ✅ Reduced New Chat button height from `h-12` to `h-10`
- ✅ Made conversation items more compact (`h-12` instead of `h-16`)

### 2. **New Chat Not Clearing Messages** - FIXED
**Problem:** When clicking "New Chat", old messages from previous conversation were still showing instead of starting fresh.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Fixed timing issue in `startNewConversation()` function
- ✅ Clear messages state immediately: `setMessages([])`
- ✅ Added 100ms delay before adding welcome messages to ensure state updates
- ✅ Proper error handling for welcome message addition
- ✅ Messages now clear instantly when creating new conversation
