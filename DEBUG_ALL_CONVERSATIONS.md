# 🔍 Debug All Conversations Updating Issue

## 🎯 **Enhanced Debugging Added**

I've added extensive debugging to track exactly what's happening when you send messages and switch conversations.

### 📊 **Debug Logs Added:**

1. **`sendMessage` function:**
   - Shows conversation ID being used
   - Shows current conversationId state
   - Shows message object details

2. **`switchConversation` function:**
   - Shows conversation being switched to
   - Shows current conversationId before switch
   - Shows conversationId after setting

3. **`ConversationList` component:**
   - Shows all conversations loaded from database
   - Shows message counts for each conversation

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions:**

1. **Open** http://localhost:1420
2. **Open DevTools** (F12) → **Console tab**
3. **Send a message** in current conversation
4. **Click "New Chat"** and send another message
5. **Switch between conversations** in sidebar
6. **Watch console logs** carefully

## 🔍 **What to Look For:**

### When Sending Messages:
```
📤 Sending message to conversation: conv_xxx
📤 Current conversationId state: conv_xxx
📤 Message object: { id: "msg_xxx", conversation_id: "conv_xxx", content: "..." }
```

### When Switching Conversations:
```
🔄 Switching to conversation: conv_yyy
🔄 Current conversationId before switch: conv_xxx
🔄 ConversationId set to: conv_yyy
```

### When Loading Conversations (every 2 seconds):
```
📋 Loaded conversations: [
  { id: "conv_xxx", title: "...", message_count: 3 },
  { id: "conv_yyy", title: "...", message_count: 2 }
]
```

## 🐛 **Potential Issues to Identify:**

1. **Same conversation ID being used for all messages:**
   - All `📤 Sending message to conversation:` logs show same ID
   - This means `conversationId` state is not updating

2. **Conversation switching not working:**
   - `🔄 ConversationId set to:` shows same ID as before
   - This means `setConversationId` is not working

3. **Database issue:**
   - `📋 Loaded conversations:` shows all conversations with same message count
   - This means messages are being saved to wrong conversation

## ✅ **Please Test and Report:**

1. **What conversation IDs do you see in the logs?**
2. **Do the conversation IDs change when you switch conversations?**
3. **Do the message counts in the loaded conversations look correct?**
4. **Are all conversations showing the same message count?**

This will help me identify exactly where the issue is occurring! 🔍
