# 🔍 Debug New Chat Functionality

## 🧪 **Testing with Debug Logs**

The server is running at **http://localhost:1420** with extensive debugging enabled.

### 📋 **Testing Steps:**

1. **Open** http://localhost:1420
2. **Open DevTools** (F12) → **Console tab**
3. **Send 2-3 messages** in current conversation
4. **Click "New Chat"** button
5. **Watch console logs** to see exactly what's happening

### 📊 **Expected Console Output:**

When you click "New Chat", you should see:
```
🔄 Starting new conversation - clearing messages
✅ Messages cleared
✅ Created new conversation: conv_1234567890_abc123
📝 Adding welcome messages to new conversation
✅ Welcome messages added to state
💾 Saved welcome messages to database
✅ Conversation ID set to: conv_1234567890_abc123
🔄 useEffect triggered - loading messages for: conv_1234567890_abc123
📥 Loading messages for conversation: conv_1234567890_abc123
📥 Loaded 2 messages: ["Welcome to LOS! Your Life...", "Hello! I'm your LOS assista..."]
```

### 🔍 **What to Look For:**

1. **Are messages being cleared?** Look for "✅ Messages cleared"
2. **Are welcome messages being added?** Look for "✅ Welcome messages added to state"
3. **Is useEffect overriding?** Look for "🔄 useEffect triggered" after setting conversation ID
4. **What messages are loaded?** Check the "📥 Loaded X messages" line

### 🐛 **Potential Issues:**

1. **If useEffect runs immediately after setting conversation ID:**
   - This means our timing approach isn't working
   - We need a different strategy

2. **If old messages are loaded instead of welcome messages:**
   - There's a database issue
   - Messages aren't being saved correctly

3. **If messages aren't cleared:**
   - React state update issue
   - Component not re-rendering

### 📝 **Please Test and Report:**

1. **What console logs do you see?**
2. **What messages appear in the chat?**
3. **Does the chat area clear at all?**
4. **Are welcome messages visible?**

This will help me identify exactly where the issue is occurring! 🔍
