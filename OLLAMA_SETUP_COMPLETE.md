## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **If AI responses are slow:**
- This is normal for the first response (model loading)
- Subsequent responses should be faster
- llama3.1:8b requires decent hardware

### **If you see "AI Offline":**
```bash
# Check Ollama status
curl http://localhost:11434

# If not running, start it
ollama serve
```

### **If model not found:**
```bash
# Verify model is installed
ollama list

# Should show: llama3.1:8b
```
